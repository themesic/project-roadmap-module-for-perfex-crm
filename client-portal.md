## 📋 Project Updates

When clients view their project in the **client portal**, they see:

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Recent activity** | Staff actions (task added, project updated, etc.) |
| **Milestone approvals** | Pending milestones with Approve/Reject buttons |

## ✅ Milestone Approval Workflow

Clients can sign off on milestones directly from the portal.

### For Clients

1. Log in to the **client portal**
2. Open **Projects** → select a project
3. In the **Client Approval – Milestone** section, see pending milestones
4. Click **Approve** or **Reject**
5. If rejecting, optionally add feedback in the text field

### For Admins

- Admins can also approve/reject from the admin area

## 🎨 Branded Portal

Admins can customize the client portal appearance:

- **Project Roadmap → Branded Portal Settings**
